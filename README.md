**This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end
process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing
query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.**
```sql
-- create table
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```

##Easy Level

1. **Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.**
```sql
select * from spotify
where stream > 1000000000
```
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
```sql
select distinct album, artist 
from spotify
order by 1
```   
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.
```sql
select 
       sum(comments) as total_comments
from spotify
where licensed = 'true'
```
5. Find all tracks that belong to the album type single .
6. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

Medium Level

1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.

Advanced Level

1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
3. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each
album.
